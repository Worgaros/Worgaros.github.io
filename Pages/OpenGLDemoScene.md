# Scene Exporter Tool Technical Document


## Introduction

As part of the 5300 module we have to create a 3D demo scene with OpenGL using computer graphics techniques.
To do this demo scene I follow courses of my teachers Elias Farhan and Frederic Dubouchet and tutorials from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com).

## Scene

My scene consist of an spatial library of objects where a objects with differents techniques of graphics techniques. The camera start at a position to see meteors and go front of the different objects each 10 seconds.
Among present objects there are a hourglass, a cube, a F1 car and meteors.

## Implementation

### Model Loading

Objects are .obj with their materials files. They are loaded with Assimp a library to load 3D models.
Textures are images .png or . jpg. They are loaded with stb 

### Lighting



### Blending



### Normal Mapping



### Stencil Buffer



### Instancing
