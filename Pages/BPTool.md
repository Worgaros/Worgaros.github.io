## Introduction

As part of the 5100 module we have to create a tool for the third year. The tool that we have to do with Solange Schmid () is the Scene Exporter Tool, a tool who have to write unity scene objets in a json file.

## Tool

At the start when a player logs his car spawn, when the two cars are spawned a countdown is launched before the game start.

You can use up and down keys to accelerate and slow down. You have to use left and right keys to turn your car.
The car stop automatically if you do not accelerate or slow down.

When a car touch the ball, it take his direction and a little bit more of his velocity.
The ball stop automatically.

When the ball touch the left or right limitations, it bounces on it.

When the ball touch the top or the bottom of the screen a goal is scored. Cars and the ball respawn at start positions.

When a player have no more life the other player win the game and the game stopped.
