## Introduction

As part of the 5100 module we have to create a tool for the third year. The tool that we have to do with Solange Schmid ([https://sosolamojo.github.io](https://sosolamojo.github.io)) is the Scene Exporter Tool, a tool who have to covert and write unity scene objets in a json format file.

## Tool

To display the tool, click on the "Tool" tab located on the top bar and then click on "Scene Exporter". It is then possible to place it wherever you want in the Unity interface.

The tool interface was created using the Unity GUI functions.
Here is a schema explaining the interface of the tool:
